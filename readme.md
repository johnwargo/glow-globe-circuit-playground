# Glow Globe Circuit Playground

My children were born in late October, so we always make a big deal out of the holiday. Its also a great opportunity to do some cool projects. A few of years ago I created a remote-controlled flame throwing pumpkin (which I hope to publish someday) and last year, due to COVID restrictions, we passed out candy using a Candypult (candy catapult) I created out of some boards and rubber bands; the kids love it!

Last year I purchased some plastic globes and my wife frosted the inside to make them translucent. The plan was to put a microcontroller, microphone, LEDs, and a battery inside and do some cool light flickering based on sounds nearby. I started with an Adafruit Feather microcontroller and the [SparkFun Electret Microphone Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12758), but no matter what I did, I could never get the microphone to accurately measure sound level. I played around with it last year and again this year and almost gave up.

I recently joined Oracle as a product manager and discovered the [Oracle Education Foundation](https://oraclefoundation.org/index.html) and quickly volunteered to help in their Hello Circuit Playground program. The program uses the [Adafruit Circuit Playground](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-circuit-playground/overview) to help teach high school students Design Thinking and microcontroller-based project development.
