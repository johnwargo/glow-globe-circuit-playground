# Glow Globe Circuit Playground

My children were born in late October, so we always make a big deal out of the holiday. Its also a great opportunity to do some cool projects. A few of years ago I created a remote-controlled flame throwing pumpkin (which I hope to publish someday) and last year, due to COVID restrictions, we passed out candy using a Candupult I created out of some boards and rubber bands.
